# Summary
This repo belongs to the project assigned as a part of the Microsoft's Mars Colonization Program.

Microsoft Engage 2020!
Theme of the program - Mars colonisation

This tic-tac-toe game was built as a part of entertainment system of Mars Rover to keep the crew entertained. The aim of the project was to create an unbeatable tic-tac-toe game using the basics of artificial intelligence and game theory.

# Tech Stack:
  - FrontEnd: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
  - Backend: JavaScript with jQuery basics.
  - Algorithm: MiniMax algorithm for unbeatable level.
  
# Additional features:
Along with the unbeatable AI agent, I added different modes to the game. A 'Human vs Human' and a 'Human vs Computer' mode was designed wherein you can choose your opponent. Human vs Computer mode includes four difficulty levels, namely: Beginner, Intermediate, Pro and Unbeatable. I desinged the algorithms of the other three difficulty levels by breaking up the Minimax algorithm. The beginner level randomly selects positions. In the intermediate level, the program goes to depth 1 and confirms win. In the pro level, the algo goes to depth 2. In minimax, the algo goes to 'n' depth according to the need.
